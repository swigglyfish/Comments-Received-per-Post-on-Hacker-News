    "The two most important conclusions from this analysis are that Ask HN posts are much more likely to get comments than Show HN posts (10.39 vs. 4.89) and that the time of day drastically affects how many comments a post is likely to receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "03:00 - 03:59 PM is by far the best hour to post an Ask HN query if you want to recieve answers to your query. The average Ask HN post created in this time period receives 28.68 comments on average, while the next best time to post (01:00 - 01:59 PM) only receives 16.32 comments on average. The range between possible values is also very drastic, as the least best hour to post an Ask HN query (09:00 - 09:59 AM) receives only 6.65 comments on average, less than a quarter of comments a post at 03:00 - 03:59 PM is likely to receive. However, note that even if an Ask HN post is posted at this time, it will still likely receive more comments than a Show HN post (no matter the time of day), which receives 4.89 comments on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Ask HN posts published in the afternoon are most likely to receive comments, as the top four comment-receiving hours are all in the afternoon. This makes some logistical sense as people usually get of work at around mid-afternoon and then have several hours of leisure time in the evening in which they can respond to comments. Understandably, very few comments get answered late at night or in the very early morning, when most people are sleeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Show HN posts published at 12:00 - 12:59 PM have twice as many comments as those publisehd at 05:00 - 05:59 AM, the time of day is much less likely to affect how many comments you recieve than it is for the Ask HN posts. However, it is still notebable that posts that are published between Early Morning and Early Afternoon are much more likley to receive comments than those published outside of that time frame."
